This yields a quadratic algorithm deciding the equality of diagrams in a free double category. The translation is of interest in its own right since and can for instance be used to reason about double categories with the language of 2-categories, sidestepping the pinwheel problem. It also shows that although double categories are formally more general than 2-categories, they are not actually more expressive, explaining the rarity of applications of  this notion."},

We port the interleaving and bottleneck distances to this novel framework and generalize classical equalities and inequalities. Unlike sets and vector spaces, in many categories the rank of an object does not identify it up to isomorphism: to preserve information about the structure of persistence modules, we define colorable ranks, persistence diagrams and prove the equality between multicolored bottleneck distance and interleaving distance in semisimple Abelian categories.

Specifically, we show that every Frobenius object in a monoidal category $M$ arises from an ambijunction (simultaneous left and right adjoints) in some 2-category $\\mathcal{D}$ into which $M$ fully and faithfully embeds. Since a 2D topological quantum field theory is equivalent to a commutative Frobenius algebra, this result also shows that every 2D TQFT is obtained from an ambijunction in some 2-category. Our theorem is proved by extending the theory of adjoint monads to the context of an arbitrary 2-category and utilizing the free completion under Eilenberg-Moore objects.  We then categorify this theorem by replacing the monoidal category $M$ with a semistrict monoidal 2-category $M$, and replacing the 2-category $\\mathcal{D}$ into which it embeds by a semistrict 3-category.  To state this more powerful result, we must first define the notion of a `Frobenius pseudomonoid', which categorifies that of a Frobenius object. We then define the notion of a `pseudo ambijunction', categorifying that of an ambijunction. In each case, the idea is that all the usual axioms now hold only up to coherent isomorphism.

The consideration of lax morphisms leads us to a new characterization of those monads, studied by Kock and Zoberlein, for which `structure is adjoint to unit', and which we now call  lax-idempotent 2-monads: both these and their  colax-idempotent duals are fully property-like.

Any lax functor into Y factors through Y-mnd and the 1-cells turn out to be the familiar bimodules.  The locally ordered bicategory rel and its bicategory of monads both fail to be Cauchy-complete, but have a well-known Cauchy-completion in common.  This prompts us to formulate a concept of Cauchy-completeness for bicategories that are not locally ordered and suggests a weakening of the notion of monad.  For this purpose, we develop a calculus of general modules between unstructured endo-1-cells.  These behave well with respect  to composition, but in general fail to have identities.  To overcome this problem, we do not need to impose the full structure of a monad on endo-1-cells.  We show that associative coequalizing multiplications suffice and call the resulting structures    interpolads.  Together with structure-preserving i-modules these form a bicategory Y-int that is indeed Cauchy-complete, in our sense, and contains the bicategory of monads as a not necessarily full sub-bicategory.  Interpolads over rel are idempotent relations, over the suspension of set they correspond to interpolative semi-groups, and over spn they lead to a notion of ``category without identities'' also known as ``taxonomy''.  If Y locally has equalizers, then modules in general, and the bicategories Y-mnd and Y-int in particular, inherit the property of being closed with respect to 1-cell composition."},

Note that the latter is a noncommutative logic; we also consider the noncommutative version of FILL.  The essential difference between FILL and BILL lies in requiring that a certain tensorial strength be an isomorphism. In any FILL category, it is possible to isolate a full subcategory of objects (the ``nucleus'') for which this transformation is an isomorphism. In addition, we define and study the appropriate categorical structure underlying the MIX rule.

In the most familiar such categories, the answer to these questions is obviously yes.  However, the category $\\cal M_G$ of Mackey functors for a compact Lie group $G$ is a category of this type in which projective objects need not be so well-behaved.  This category is of interest since good equivariant cohomology theories are Mackey functor valued.  The tensor product on $\\cal M_G$ is important in this context because of the role it plays in the not yet fully understood universal coefficient and K\\\"{u}nneth formulae.  This role makes the relationship between projective objects and the tensor product especially critical. Unfortunately, if $G$ is, for example, $O(n)$, then projectives need not be flat in $\\cal M_G$ and the tensor product of projective objects need not be projective.  This misbe haviorcomplicates the search for full strength equivariant universal coefficient and K\\\"{u}nneth formulae.\nThe primary purpose of this article is to investigate these questions about the interaction of the tensor product with projective objects in   symmetric monoidal abelian categories.  Our focus is on functor categories whose monoidal structures arise in a fashion described by Day. Conditions are given under which such a structure interacts appropriately  with projective objects.  Further, examples are given to show that, when these conditions aren't met, this interaction can be quite bad.  These examples were not fabricated to illustrate the abstract possibility of misbehavior.  Rather, they are drawn from the literature.  In particular, $\\cal M_G$ is badly behaved not only for the groups $O(n)$, but also for the groups $SO(n)$, $U(n)$, $SU(n)$, $Sp(n)$, and $ Spin(n)$.  Similar misbehavior occurs in two categories of global Mackey functors which are   widely used in the study of classifying spaces of finite groups.  Given  the extent of the homological misbehavior in Mackey functor categories    described here, it is reasonable to expect that similar problems occur in other functor categories carrying symmetric monoidal closed structures provided by Day's machinery."},

The Artin group of braids of $n$ strands has an order-invariant action in the ramification groupoid of the sphere with $n+1$ marked-points. Left-invariant linear orderings of the braid group such as the Dehornoy ordering may be retrieved. Our work extends naturally to the braid group on countably many generators.

As an application, the special case of an algebraic theory T is considered and simple characterizations for a recognizable forest are given.

The general notion of a module between two morphisms of bicategories is described. These modules together with their (multi-)2-cells, which we call modulations, organize themselves into a multi-bicategory.  The usual notion of a module can be recovered from this general notion by simply choosing the domain bicategory to be the terminal or final bicategory.\nThe composite of two such modules need not exist.  However, when the domain bicategory is small and the codomain bicategory is locally cocomplete then the composite of any two modules does exist and has a simple construction using the local colimits.  These modules and their modulations then give rise to a bicategory.\nRecall that neither transformations nor optransformations (respectively lax natural transformations and oplax natural transformations) between morphisms of bicategories give rise to a smooth 3-dimensional structure. However, there is a smooth 3-dimensional structure for modules, and both transformations and optransformations give rise to associated modules.  Furthermore, the modulations between two modules associated with transformations can then be described directly as a new sort of modification between the transformations.  This provides a locally full and faithful homomorphism from transformations and modifications into the bicategory of modules.\nFinally, if each 1-cell component of a transformation is a left-adjoint then the right-adjoints provide an optransformation.  In the module bicategory the module associated with this optransformation is right-adjoint to the module associated with the transformation. Therefore the inclusion of transformations whose 1-cells have left adjoints into the (multi-)bicategory of modules provides a source of proarrow equipment."},

Seely", "keywords": ["Bicategories", "polycategories", "multicategories", "modules", "representation theorems"], "abstract": "Linear bicategories are a generalization of ordinary bicategories in which there are two horizontal (1-cell) compositions corresponding to the ``tensor'' and ``par'' of linear logic. Benabou's notion of a morphism (lax 2-functor) of bicategories  may be generalized to linear bicategories, where they are called linear functors.  Unfortunately, as for the bicategorical case, it is not obvious how to organize linear functors smoothly into a higher dimensional structure. Not only do linear functors seem to lack the two compositions expected for a linear bicategory but, even worse, they inherit from the bicategorical level the failure to combine well with the obvious notion of transformation. As we shall see, there are also problems with lifting the notion of lax transformation to the linear setting.\nOne possible resolution is to step up one dimension, taking morphisms as the 0-cell level.  In the linear setting, this suggests making linear functors 0-cells, but what structure should sit above them?  Lax transformations in a suitable sense just do not seem to work very well for this purpose (Section \\ref{S:linnattran}). Modules provide a more promising direction, but raise a number of technical issues concerning the composability of both the modules and their transformations.  In general the required composites will not exist in either the linear bicategorical or ordinary bicategorical setting.  However, when these composites do exist modules between linear functors do combine to form a linear bicategory.   In order to better understand the conditions for the existence of composites, we have found it convenient, particularly in the linear setting, to develop the theory of ``poly-bicategories''.  In this setting we can develop the theory so as to extract the answers to these problems not only for linear bicategories but also for ordinary bicategories.  Poly-bicategories are 2-dimensional generalizations of Szabo's poly-categories, consisting of objects, 1-cells, and poly-2-cells. The latter may have several 1-cells as input and as output and can be composed by means of cutting along a single 1-cell.  While a poly-bicategory does not require that there be any compositions for the 1-cells, such composites are determined (up to 1-cell isomorphism) by their universal properties.  We say a poly-bicategory is representable when there is a representing 1-cell for each of the two possible 1-cell compositions geared towards the domains and codomains of the poly 2-cells.  In this case we recover the notion of a linear bicategory. The poly notions of functors, modules and their transformations are introduced as well.  The poly-functors between two given poly-bicategories P and P' together with poly-modules  between poly-functors and their transformations form a new poly-bicategory provided P is representable and closed in the sense that every  1-cell has both a left and a right adjoint (in the appropriate linear sense). Finally we revisit the notion of linear (or lax) natural transformations, which can only be defined for representable poly-bicategories.  These in fact correspond to modules having special properties."},

Various versions of this notion have already been explored; our goal here is to provide a detailed introduction to two, which we call `weak' and `coherent' 2-groups. A weak 2-group is a weak monoidal category in which every morphism has an inverse and every object x has a `weak inverse': an object y such that x \\tensor y \\iso 1 \\iso y \\tensor x. A coherent 2-group is a weak 2-group in which every object x is equipped with a  specified weak inverse x' and isomorphisms i_x  : 1 -&gt; x \\tensor x',  e_x : x' \\tensor x -&gt; 1 forming an adjunction.  We describe 2-categories of weak and coherent 2-groups and an `improvement' 2-functor that turns weak 2-groups into coherent ones, and prove that this 2-functor is a 2-equivalence of 2-categories.  We internalize the concept of coherent 2-group, which gives a quick way to define Lie 2-groups.  We give a tour of examples, including the `fundamental 2-group' of a space and various Lie 2-groups.  We also explain how coherent 2-groups can be classified in terms of 3rd cohomology classes in group cohomology.  Finally, using this classification, we construct for any connected and simply-connected compact simple Lie group G a family of 2-groups G_h (h in Z) having G as its group of objects and U(1) as the group of automorphisms of its identity object.  These 2-groups are built using Chern-Simons theory, and are closely related to the Lie 2-algebras g_h (h in R) described in a companion paper."},

When the category that we complete is not left exact but has some weaker kind of limit for finite diagrams, the universal property of the completion is usually stated with respect to functors that enjoy a property reminiscent of flatness.  In this fashion notions like that of a left covering or a multilimit merging functor have appeared in the literature.  We show here that such notions coincide with flatness when the latter is interpreted relative to (the internal logic of) a site structure associated to the target category.  We exploit this in order to show that the left Kan extensions of such functors, along the inclusion of their domain into its completion, are left exact.  This gives in a very economical and uniform manner the universal property of such completions.  Our result relies heavily on some unpublished work of A. Kock from 1989.

It is shown that there is a non-trivial monotone-light factorization for simplicial sets, such that the monotone-light factorization for reflexive graphs via reflexive relations is a special case of it, obtained by truncation. More generally, we will show that there exists a monotone-light factorization associated with every full subcategory Mono(F_n), n &gt;= 0, consisting of all simplicial sets whose unit morphisms are monic for the localization $F_n:\\mathbf{Set}^{\\Delta^{op}}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Set}^{\\Delta^{op}_n}$, which truncates each simplicial set after the object of n-simplices.

For a Grothendieck topos C we get a structure that, though different from Joyal and Tierney's, has an equivalent homotopy category. In case C is semi-abelian, these weak equivalences turn out to be homology isomorphisms, and the model structure on CatC induces a notion of homotopy of internal crossed modules. In case C is the category Gp of groups and homomorphisms, it reduces to the case of crossed modules of groups.\nThe trivial topology on a category C determines a model structure on CatC where we is the class of strong equivalences (homotopy equivalences), fib the class of internal functors with the homotopy lifting property, and cof the class of functors with the homotopy extension property. As a special case, the ``folk'' Quillen model category structure on the category Cat = CatSet of small categories is recovered."},

Both use so-called Chu-spans as new 1-cells between   1-cells of the underlying bicategory, which form the new objects.   Chu-spans may be seen as a natural generalization of 2-cell-spans   in the base bicategory that no longer are confined to a single   hom-category.  This view helps to clarify the composition of   Chu-spans.\nWe consider various approaches of linking the underlying bicategory   with the newly constructed ones, e.g. by means of two-dimensional   generalizations of bifibrations.  In the quest for a better   connection, we investigate, whether Chu-spans form a double   category.  While this turns out not to be the case, we are led to   considering a generalization of the construction to paths of 1-cells in   the base, leading to two hierarchies of closed bicategories, one for   linear paths and one for loops.  The possibility of moving beyond   paths, respectively, loops of the same length is indicated.\nFinally, Chu-spans in rel are identified as bipartite state  transition   systems.  Even though their composition may fail here due to the   lack of pullbacks in rel, basic game-theoretic constructions can   be performed on cyclic Chu-spans.  These are available in all   symmetric monoidal closed categories with finite products.  If   pullbacks exist as well, the bicategory of cyclic Chu-spans inherits   a monoidal structure that on objects coincides with the categorical   product."},

These diagrams form a cubical set with compositions $x +_i y$ in all directions, which are computed using pushouts and behave `categorically' in a weak sense, up to suitable comparisons. Actually, we work with a `symmetric cubical structure', which includes the transposition symmetries, because this allows for a strong simplification of the coherence conditions. These notions will be used in subsequent papers to study topological cospans and their use in Algebraic Topology, from tangles to cobordisms of manifolds.\nWe also introduce the more general notion of a multiple category, where - to start with - arrows belong to different sorts, varying in a countable family, and symmetries must be dropped. The present examples seem to show that the symmetric cubical case is better suited for topological applications."},

Many bicategorical notions do not work   well in these cases, because the `morphisms between 0-cells', such   as ring homomorphisms, are missing.  We can include them by using a   pseudo double category, but usually these morphisms also induce base   change functors acting on the 1-cells.  We avoid complicated   coherence problems by describing base change `nonalgebraically',   using categorical fibrations.  The resulting `framed bicategories'   assemble into 2-categories, with attendant notions of equivalence,   adjunction, and so on which are more appropriate for our examples   than are the usual bicategorical ones.\nWe then describe two ways to construct framed bicategories.  One is   an analogue of rings and bimodules which starts from one framed   bicategory and builds another.  The other starts from a `monoidal   fibration', meaning a parametrized family of monoidal categories,   and produces an analogue of the framed bicategory of spans.

A differential category is an additive symmetric monoidal category with a comonad (a \"coalgebra modality\") and a differential combinator. The morphisms of a differential category should be thought of as the linear maps; the differentiable or smooth maps would then be morphisms of the coKleisli category.  The purpose of the present paper is to directly axiomatize differentiable maps and thus to move the emphasis from the linear notion to structures resembling the coKleisli category. The result is a setting with a more evident and intuitive relationship to the familiar notion of calculus on smooth maps. Indeed a primary example is the category whose objects are Euclidean spaces and whose morphisms are smooth maps.\nA Cartesian differential category is a Cartesian left additive category which possesses a Cartesian differential operator. The differential operator itself must satisfy a number of equations, which guarantee, in particular, that the differential of any map is `\"linear\" in a suitable sense.\nWe present an analysis of the basic properties of Cartesian differential categories.  We show that under modest and natural assumptions, the coKleisli category of a differential category is Cartesian differential.  Finally we present a (sound and complete) term calculus for these categories which allows their structure to be analysed using essentially the same language one might use for traditional multi-variable calculus."},

An intermediate result that is important in its own right is that the scalars in such a category necessarily form an involutive field. In case of a Hilbert category, the embedding extends to the category of Hilbert spaces and continuous linear maps.

Let us call a pointed regular category $\\mathbb{C}$ normal if every regular epimorphism in $\\mathbb{C}$ is a normal epimorphism. It is well known that any homological category in the sense of F. Borceux and D. Bourn is both normal and subtractive. We prove that in any subtractive normal category, the upper and lower $3\\times 3$ lemmas hold true, which generalizes a similar result for homological categories due to D. Bourn (note that the middle $3\\times 3$ lemma holds true if and only if the category is homological). The technique of proof is new: the pointed subobject functor $\\mathcal{S}=\\mathrm{Sub}(-):\\mathbb{C}\\rightarrow\\mathbf{Set}_*$ turns out to have suitable preservation/reflection properties which allow us to reduce the proofs of these two diagram lemmas to the standard diagram-chasing arguments in $\\mathbf{Set}_*$ (alternatively, we could use the more advanced embedding theorem for regular categories due to M.~Barr). The key property of $\\mathcal{S}$, which allows to obtain these diagram lemmas, is the preservation of subtractive spans. Subtractivity of a span provides a weaker version of the rule of subtraction --- one of the elementary rules for chasing  diagrams in abelian categories, in the sense of S. Mac Lane. A pointed regular category is subtractive if and only if every span in it is subtractive, and moreover, the functor $\\mathcal{S}$ not only preserves but also reflects subtractive spans. Thus, subtractivity seems to be exactly what we need in order to prove the upper/lower $3\\times 3$ lemmas in a normal category. Indeed, we show that a normal category is subtractive if and only if these $3\\times 3$ lemmas hold true in it. Moreover, we show that for any pointed regular category $\\mathbb{C}$ (not necessarily a normal one), we have: $\\mathbb{C}$ is subtractive if and only if the lower $3\\times 3$ lemma holds true in $\\mathbb{C}$."},

The discussion of one-dimensional cohomology $H^{1}$ in a fairly general category E involves passing to the 2-category Cat(E) of categories E.  In particular, the coefficient object is a category B in E and the torsors that $H^{1}$  classifies are particular functors in E. We only impose conditions on E that are satisfied also by Cat(E)  and argue that $H^{1}$ for Cat(E) is a kind of $H^{2}$ for E, and so on recursively. For us, it is too much to ask E to be a topos (or even internally complete) since, even if E is, Cat(E) is not. With this motivation, we are led to examine morphisms in E which act as internal families and to internalize the comprehensive factorization of functors into a final functor followed by a discrete fibration. We define B-torsors for a category B in E and prove clutching and classification theorems. The former theorem clutches Cech cocycles to construct torsors while the latter constructs a coefficient category to classify structures locally isomorphic to members of a given internal family of structures. We conclude with applications to examples."},

We introduce this idea with a detailed exposition of `degroupoidification': a systematic process that turns groupoids and spans into vector spaces and linear operators.  Then we present three applications of groupoidification.  The first is to Feynman diagrams. The Hilbert space for the quantum harmonic oscillator arises naturally from degroupoidifying the groupoid of finite sets and bijections. This allows for a purely combinatorial interpretation of creation and annihilation operators, their commutation relations, field operators, their normal-ordered powers, and finally Feynman diagrams.  The second application is to Hecke algebras.  We explain how to groupoidify the Hecke algebra associated to a Dynkin diagram whenever the deformation parameter $q$ is a prime power.  We illustrate this with the simplest nontrivial example, coming from the $A_2$ Dynkin diagram.  In this example we show that the solution of the Yang--Baxter equation built into the $A_2$ Hecke algebra arises naturally from the axioms of projective geometry applied to the projective plane over the finite field $\\mathbb{F}_q$.  The third application is to Hall algebras.  We explain how the standard construction of the Hall algebra from the category of $\\mathbb{F}_q$ representations of a simply-laced quiver can be seen as an example of degroupoidification.  This in turn provides a new way to categorify - or more precisely, groupoidify - the positive part of the quantum group associated to the quiver."},

To extend to nondeterministic and stochastic automata such a monadic formalism, it is suitable to resort to a notion richer than the one of monad, but equally basic: the notion of distributive law between two monads. The notion of algebra on a monad is then generalized by the one of algebra for a distributive law. The nondeterministic and stochastic automata are precisely algebras for distributive laws whose first monad is $T_M$. If the nondeterministic case involves a distributive law between $T_M$ and the well-known power set monad, the stochastic case involves a distributive law between $T_M$ (where, here, $M$ is a measurable monoid) and the probability monad. This allows presentation of the stochastic automata as algebras for this distributive law. This paper taking place at the confluence of category, automata and probability theories, we have, for the convenience of the reader not aware of each area, made useful reviews about these subjects (in several appendices).

We determine the resulting homotopy category. We also introduce a \"finite-level\" homotopy category which respects the natural topology on the set of walks. To each graph we associate a basal graph, well defined up to isomorphism.   We show that the basal graph is a homotopy invariant for our model structure, and that it is a finer invariant than the zeta series of a finite graph.

To accomplish this goal, we make use of a graphical notation for functors between monoidal categories, using string diagrams with coloured regions. Not only does this notation extend our capacity to give simple proofs of complicated calculations, it makes plain some of the connections between Frobenius monoidal or separable Frobenius monoidal functors and the topology of the axioms defining certain algebraic structures.

We study actions of $G$ on objects $A$ of $\\mathbb C$  (defined by Bourn and Janelidze as being algebras over a certain monad $\\mathbb T_G$), with two objectives: investigating to which extent actions can be described in terms of smaller data, called action cores; and to single out those abstract action cores which extend to actions corresponding to semi-direct products of $A$ and $G$ (in a non-exact setting, not every action does). This amounts to exhibiting a subcategory of the category of the actions of $G$ on objects $A$ which is equivalent with the category of points in $\\mathbb C$ over $G$, and to describing it in terms of action cores.  This notion and its study are based on a preliminary investigation of co-smash products, in which cross-effects of functors in a general categorical context turn out to be a useful tool. The co-smash products also allow us to define higher categorical commutators, different from the ones of Huq, which are not generally expressible in terms of nested binary ones. We use strict action cores to show that any normal subobject of an object $E$ (i.e., the equivalence class of $0$ for some equivalence relation on $E$ in $\\mathbb C$) admits a strict conjugation action of $E$. If $\\mathbb C$ is semi-abelian, we show that for subobjects $X$, $Y$ of some object $A$, $X$ is proper in the supremum of $X$ and $Y$ if and only if $X$ is stable under the restriction to $Y$ of the conjugation action of $A$ on itself. This also amounts to an alternative proof of Bourn and Janelidze's category equivalence between points over $G$ in $\\mathbb C$ and actions of $G$ in the semi-abelian context.  Finally, we show that the two axioms of an algebra which characterize $G$-actions are equivalent with three others ones, in terms of action cores. These axioms are commutative squares involving only co-smash products. Two of them are associativity type conditions which generalize the usual properties of an action of one group on another, while the third is kind of a higher coherence condition which is a consequence of the other two in the category of groups, but probably not in general. As an application, we characterize abelian action cores, that is, action cores corresponding to Beck modules; here also the coherence condition follows from the others."},

In particular, there is a super Fermat theory of $C^\\infty$-superalgebras. $C^\\infty$-superalgebras are the appropriate notion of supercommutative algebras in the world of $C^\\infty$-rings, the latter being of central importance both to synthetic differential geometry and to all existing models of derived smooth manifolds.

Upon choosing certain examples of Lie 2-groups, our axiomatic framework reproduces in a systematical way several known concepts of gerbes with connection: non-abelian differential cocycles, Breen-Messing gerbes, abelian and non-abelian bundle gerbes. These relationships convey a well-defined notion of surface holonomy from our axiomatic framework to each of these concrete models. Till now, holonomy was only known for abelian gerbes; our approach reproduces that known concept and extends it to non-abelian gerbes.

The function $f$ can be thought of as a measurement process, while $s$ provides a hypothesis about the state of the measured system given the result of a measurement.  Given this data we can define the entropy of the probability distribution on $X$ relative to the `prior' given by pushing the probability distribution on $Y$ forwards along $s$.  We say that $s$ is `optimal' if these distributions agree.  We show that any convex linear, lower semicontinuous functor from FinStat to the additive monoid $[0,\\infty]$ which vanishes when $s$ is optimal must be a scalar multiple of this relative entropy.

More specifically, we study the algebraic nature of assembling complex dynamical systems from an interconnection of simpler ones. The syntactic architecture of such interconnections is encoded using the visual language of wiring diagrams. We define the symmetric monoidal category $W$, from which we may construct an operad $OW$, whose objects are black boxes with input and output ports, and whose morphisms are wiring diagrams, thus prescribing the algebraic rules for interconnection. We then define two $W$-algebras} $G$ and $L$, which associate semantic content to the structures in $W$. Respectively, they correspond to general and to linear systems of differential equations, in which an internal state is controlled by inputs and produces outputs. As an example, we use these algebras to formalize the classical problem of systems of tanks interconnected by pipes, and hence make explicit the algebraic relationships among systems at different levels of granularity."},

Following the work of Lack, these universal objects must be constructed from simplicial objects arising from our monad-theoretic framework, as certain 2-categorical colimits called codescent objects. We isolate the extra structure present on these simplicial objects which enable their codescent objects to be computed. These are the crossed internal categories of the title, and generalise the crossed simplicial groups of Loday and Fiedorowicz. The most general results of this article are concerned with how to compute such codescent objects in 2-categories of internal categories, and on isolating conditions on the monad-theoretic situation which enable these results to apply. Combined with earlier work of the author in which operads are seen as polynomial 2-monads, our results are then applied to the theory of non-symmetric, symmetric and braided operads. In particular, the well-known construction of a PROP from an operad is recovered, as an illustration of our techniques."},

This point of view reveals categorical polynomial monads as a unifying environment for operads, Cat-operads and clubs. We recover the standard construction of a monad from an operad in a 2-categorical way from our associated 2-monad as a coidentifier of 2-monads, and understand the algebras of both as weak morphisms of operads into a Cat-operad of categories. Algebras of operads within general symmetric monoidal categories arise from our new associated 2-monad in a canonical way.

The coKleisli category of any monoidal differential category is always a Cartesian differential category.  Cartesian differential categories, besides arising in this manner as coKleisli categories, occur in many different and quite independent ways.  Thus, it was not obvious how to pass from Cartesian differential categories back to monoidal differential categories.\nThis paper provides natural conditions under which the linear maps of a Cartesian differential category form a monoidal differential category. This is a question of some practical importance as much of the machinery of modern differential geometry is based on models which implicitly allow such a passage, and thus the results and tools of the area tend to freely assume access to this structure.\nThe purpose of this paper is to make precise the connection between the two types of differential categories.  As a prelude to this, however, it is convenient to have available a general theory which relates the behaviour of \"linear\" maps in Cartesian categories to the structure of Seely categories.   The latter were developed to provide the categorical semantics for (fragments of) linear logic which use a \"storage\" modality.  The general theory of storage, which underlies the results mentioned above, is developed in the opening sections of the paper and is then applied to the case of differential categories."},

While a sup lattice happens to have all infima, only the suprema are part of the algebraic structure.\nExtending this idea, we look at posets that happen to have all suprema (and therefore all infima), but we will only declare some of them to be part of the algebraic structure (which we will call joins). We find that a lot of the theory of complete distributivity for sup lattices can be extended to this context. There are a lot of natural examples of completely join-distributive partial lattice complete partial orders, including for example, the lattice of all equivalence relations on a set X, and the lattice of all subgroups of a group G. In both cases we define the join operation as union. This is a partial operation, because for example, the union of subgroups of a group is not necessarily a subgroup. However, sometimes it is, and keeping track of this can help with topics such as the inclusion-exclusion principle.\nAnother motivation for the study of sup lattices is as a simplified model for the study of presheaf categories. The construction of downsets is a form of the Yoneda embedding, and the study of downset lattices can be a useful guide for the study of presheaf categories. In this context, partial lattices can be viewed as a simplified model for the study of sheaf categories.\n"},

In some situations, a model category where the class of weak equivalences is restricted from the original one could be more desirable.  In this situation we need the notion of a delocalization.

Most of the descriptions leading to this construction were long and heavily based on the axiom of choice. In this paper we considerably simplify the description of the equivalence relation on 2-morphisms and the constructions of associators, vertical and horizontal compositions in $C[W^{-1}]$, thus proving that the axiom of choice is not needed under certain conditions.

Here we extend coarse-graining to `open' Markov processes: that is, those where probability can flow in or out of certain states called `inputs' and `outputs'.  One can build up an ordinary Markov process from smaller open pieces in two basic ways: composition, where we identify the outputs of one open Markov process with the inputs of another, and tensoring, where we set two open Markov processes side by side.  In previous work, Fong, Pollard and the first author showed that these constructions make open Markov processes into the morphisms of a symmetric monoidal category.  Here we go further by constructing a symmetric monoidal double category where the 2-morphisms include ways of coarse-graining open Markov processes.  We also extend the already known `black-boxing' functor from the category of open Markov processes to our double category.  Black-boxing sends any open Markov process to the linear relation between input and output data that holds in steady states, including nonequilibrium steady states where there is a nonzero flow of probability through the process.  To extend black-boxing to a functor between double categories, we need to prove that black-boxing is compatible with coarse-graining."},

We construct a functor, dubbed the `black box functor', that takes a circuit, forgets its internal structure, and remembers only its external behavior.  Two circuits have the same external behavior if and only if they impose same relation between currents and potentials at their terminals.  The space of these currents and potentials naturally has the structure of a symplectic vector space, and the relation imposed by a circuit is a Lagrangian linear relation.  Thus, the black box functor goes from our category of circuits to a category with Lagrangian linear relations as morphisms.

We can formalize this reasoning using props: that is, strict symmetric monoidal categories where the objects are natural numbers, with the tensor product of objects given by addition.  In this approach, each kind of network corresponds to a prop, and each network of this kind is a morphism in that prop.  A network with $m$ inputs and $n$ outputs is a morphism from $m$ to $n$, putting networks together in series is composition, and setting them side by side is tensoring.  Here we work out the details of this approach for various kinds of electrical circuits, starting with circuits made solely of ideal perfectly conductive wires, then circuits with passive linear components, and then circuits that also have voltage and current sources.  Each kind of circuit corresponds to a mathematically natural prop.  We describe the `behavior' of these circuits using morphisms between props.  In particular, we give a new construction of the black-boxing functor of Fong and the first author; unlike the original construction, this new one easily generalizes to circuits with nonlinear components.  We also use a morphism of props to clarify the relation between circuit diagrams and the signal-flow diagrams in control theory.  Technically, the key tools are the Rosebrugh-Sabadini-Walters result relating circuits to special commutative Frobenius monoids, the monadic adjunction between props and signatures, and a result saying which symmetric monoidal categories are equivalent to props."},

These metrics typically depend on the choice of a lax semigroup of endomorphisms of the poset. The purpose of the present paper is to develop a more general framework for the notion of interleaving distance using the theory of `actegories'. Specifically, we extend the notion of interleaving distance to arbitrary categories equipped with a flow, i.e. a lax monoidal action by the monoid $[0,\\infty)$. In this way, the class of objects in such a category acquires the structure of a Lawvere metric space. Functors that are colax $[0,\\infty)$-equivariant yield maps that are 1-Lipschitz. This leads to concise proofs of various known stability results from TDA, by considering appropriate colax $[0,\\infty)$-equivariant functors. Along the way, we show that several common metrics, including the Hausdorff distance and the $L^\\infty$-norm, can be realized as interleaving distances in this general perspective."},

Every small category C has associated with it a presheaf of groups on C, called its isotropy group, which in a sense solves the problem of making the assignment C |-&gt;  Aut(C) functorial. Consequently, every category has a canonical congruence that annihilates the isotropy; however, it turns out that the resulting quotient may itself have non-trivial isotropy. This phenomenon, which we term higher order isotropy, is the subject of our investigation. We show that with each category C we may associate a sequence of groups called its higher isotropy groups, and that these give rise to a sequence of quotients of C. This sequence leads us to an ordinal invariant for small categories, which we call isotropy rank: the isotropy rank of a small category is the ordinal at which the sequence of quotients stabilizes. Our main results state that each small category has a well-defined isotropy rank, and moreover, that for each small ordinal one may construct a small category with precisely that rank. It happens that isotropy rank of a small category is an instance of the same concept for Grothendieck toposes, for which corresponding statements hold.

This paper shows how to form the pullback in Span(C) for many, but not all, pairs of spans, given the existence of some specific so-called lax pullback complements in C of the \"left legs\" of at least one of the two given spans. For some types of spans we require the ambient category to be adhesive to be able to form at least a weak pullback in Span(C). The existence of all lax pullback complements in C along a given morphism is equivalent to the exponentiability of that morphism. Since exponentiability is a rather restrictive property of a morphism, the paper first develops a comprehensive framework of rules for individual lax pullback complement diagrams, which resembles the set of pasting and cancellation rules for pullback diagrams, including their behaviour under pullback. We also present examples of lax pullback complements along non-exponentiable morphisms, obtained via lifting along a fibration."},

We isolate a completeness condition, called k-quasi-completeness, and an associated notion which is stable under duality called k-reflexivity, allowing for a star-autonomous category of k-reflexive spaces in which the dual of the tensor product is the reflexive version of the epsilon-product. We adapt Meise's definition of smooth maps into a first model of Differential Linear Logic, made of k-reflexive spaces. We also build two new models of Linear Logic with conveniently smooth maps, on categories made respectively of Mackey-complete Schwartz spaces and Mackey-complete Nuclear Spaces (with extra reflexivity conditions). Varying slightly the notion of smoothness, one also recovers models of DiLL on the same star-autonomous categories.

The ubiquity of algebraic structures in mathematics and related fields has given rise to several variants of universal algebra, such as theories of symmetric operads, non-symmetric operads, generalised operads, PROPs, PROs, and monads. These variants of universal algebra are called {notions of algebraic theory}. In this paper, we develop a unified framework for them. The key observation is that each notion of algebraic theory can be identified with a monoidal category, in such a way that algebraic theories correspond to monoid objects therein. To incorporate semantics, we introduce a categorical structure called {metamodel}, which formalises a definition of models of algebraic theories. We also define morphisms between notions of algebraic theory, which are a monoidal version of profunctors. Every strong monoidal functor gives rise to an adjoint pair of such morphisms, and provides a uniform method to establish isomorphisms between categories of models in different notions of algebraic theory. A general structure-semantics adjointness result and a double categorical universal property of categories of models are also shown."},

Grandis (and hence, in particular, any abelian category), can be seen as an example of a noetherian form. In this paper we generalize the notion of a biproduct of objects in an abelian category to a noetherian form and apply it do develop commutator theory in noetherian forms. In the case of semi-abelian categories, biproducts give usual products of objects and our commutators coincide with the so-called Huq commutators (which in the case of groups are the usual commutators of subgroups). This paper thus shows that the structure of a noetherian form allows for a self-dual approach to products and commutators in semi-abelian categories, similarly as has been known for homomorphism theorems."},

In a poly-bicategory, the existence of enough 2-cells satisfying certain universal properties (representability) induces coherent algebraic structure on the 2-graph of single-input, single-output 2-cells. A special case of this theory was used by Hermida to produce a proof of strictification for bicategories. No full strictification is possible for higher-dimensional categories, seemingly due to problems with 2-cells that have degenerate boundaries; it was conjectured by C. Simpson that semi-strictification excluding units may be possible.\nWe study poly-bicategories where 2-cells with degenerate boundaries are barred, and show that we can recover the structure of a bicategory through a different construction of weak units. We prove that the existence of these units is equivalent to the existence of 1-cells satisfying lower-dimensional universal properties, and study the relation between preservation of units and universal cells.\nThen, we introduce merge-bicategories, a variant of poly-bicategories with more composition operations, which admits a natural monoidal closed structure, giving access to higher morphisms. We derive equivalences between morphisms, transformations, and modifications of representable merge-bicategories and the corresponding notions for bicategories. Finally, we prove a semi-strictification theorem for representable merge-bicategories with a choice of composites and units."},

We examine the related questions of when T freely generates a triple (or monad) on X; when an object x in X freely generates a T-algebra; and when the category of T-algebras has coequalizers and other colimits.  The paper defines a category of ``T-horns'' which effectively contains X as well as all T-algebras.  It is assume that  Xs  is cocomplete and has a factorization system (E,M) satisfying reasonable properties. An ordinal-indexed sequence of T-horns is then defined which provides successive approximations to a free T-algebra generated by an object x in X, as well as approximations to coequalizers and other colimits for the category of T-algebras.  Using the notions of an M-cone and a separated T-horn it is shown that if X is M-well-powered, then the ordinal sequence stabilizes at the desired free algebra or coequalizer or other colimit whenever they exist.  This paper is a successor to a paper written by the first author in 1970 that showed that T generates a free triple when every x in X generates a free T-algebra.

Following Van den Bergh, a closed subcategory Z which has such a functor is called well-closed.  We show that well-closedness can be characterized by the existence of certain projective effacements for each object of X, and that the needed functor F_Z has an explicit description in terms of such effacements.

This equivalence allows us to define a category of affine objects associated to a tangent category and we show that the resulting category is also a tangent category, as are several related categories.   As a consequence of some of these ideas we also give two new characterizations of flat torsion-free connections.

Namely, any symmetric strict monoidal 2-category M admits a symmetric strict monoidal 2-category of pseudomonoids, monoidal 1-cells and monoidal 2-cells in M. Dually, there is a symmetric strict monoidal 2-category of pseudomonoids, opmonoidal 1-cells and opmonoidal 2-cells in M. Extending a construction due to Aguiar and Mahajan for M = Cat, we may apply the first construction p-times and the second one q-times (in any order). It yields a 2-category M_{pq}. A 0-cell therein is an object A of M together with p+q compatible pseudomonoid structures;  it is termed a (p+q)-oidal object in M. A monad in M_{pq} is called a (p,q)-oidal monad in M; it is a monad t on A in M together with p monoidal, and q opmonoidal structures in a compatible way. If M has monoidal Eilenberg-Moore construction, and certain (Linton type) stable coequalizers exist, then a (p+q)-oidal structure on the Eilenberg-Moore object A^t of a (p,q)-oidal monad (A,t) is shown to arise via a symmetric strict monoidal double functor to Ehresmann's double category Sqr(M) of squares in M, from the double category of monads in Sqr(M) in the sense of Fiore, Gambino and Kock. While q ones of the pseudomonoid structures of A^t are lifted along the `forgetful' 1-cell A^t -&gt; A, the other p ones are lifted along its left adjoint.

Many geometric categories such as the category of topological spaces, metric spaces, ordered sets, any topos, etc., are comajority categories (i.e.~their duals are majority categories), and we show that, under mild assumptions, the only categories which are both majority and comajority, are the preorders.

Our motivation was to generalize the notion of up-to-homotopy monoid in a monoidal category, introduced by Leinster. Our formalism generalizes the classical theory of Segal categories and extends the theory of categories enriched over a 2-category. We introduce Segal dg-categories which did not exist so far. We show that the homotopy transfer problem for algebras leads directly to a Leinster-Segal algebra."},

Thus, such a D is pre-cartesian closed as a double category if and only if D_0 is a cartesian closed category. Applications include the double categories  cat, pos, spaces, loc, and topos, whose objects are small categories, posets, topological space, locales, and toposes, respectively."},

In this paper, we establish criteria implying that an ∞-category --- for instance, a quasi-category, a complete Segal space, or a Segal category --- is complete and cocomplete, admitting limits and colimits indexed by any small simplicial set. Our strategy is to build (co)limits of diagrams indexed by a simplicial set inductively from (co)limits of restricted diagrams indexed by the pieces of its skeletal filtration. We show directly that the modules that express the universal properties of (co)limits of diagrams of these shapes are reconstructible as limits of the modules that express the universal properties of (co)limits of the restricted diagrams. We also prove that the Yoneda embedding preserves and reflects limits in a suitable sense, and deduce our main theorems as a consequence."},

We conclude the paper with a proof of the fact that a sufficiently cohesive topos of presheaves does not satisfy the continuity axiom."},

Furthermore, we investigate the relation between this `global' monoidal version where the total category is monoidal and the fibration strictly preserves the structure, and a `fibrewise' one where the fibres are monoidal and the reindexing functors strongly preserve the structure, first hinted by Shulman. In particular, when the domain is cocartesian monoidal, we show how lax monoidal structures on a pseudofunctor to Cat bijectively correspond to lifts of the pseudofunctor to MonCat. Finally, we give some examples where this correspondence appears, spanning from the fundamental and family fibrations to network models and systems."},

Our constructibility condition is new and only requires that certain inclusions of open sets are sent to isomorphisms. On the other side of the equivalence is the category of functors from the entrance path category,  which has points for objects and certain homotopy classes of paths for morphisms.  When our constructible cosheaves are valued in Set we prove an additional equivalence with  the category of stratified coverings."},

One way to solve these problems is to formalise the diagrams and their semantics using hypergraph categories, with semantic interpretation a hypergraph functor, called the black box functor, between them.   Building on a previous method for constructing hypergraph categories and functors, known as decorated corelations, in this paper we construct a category of decorating data, and show that the decorated corelations method is itself functorial, with a universal property characterised by a left Kan extension. We then show that any hypergraph category can be presented in terms of decorating data, and hence argue that the category of decorating data is a good setting in which to construct any hypergraph functor. As an example, we give a new construction of Baez and Pollard's black box functor for reaction networks."},

Analogous results for the associated homotopy limit (and other intermediate limits) directly follow."},

Both left and right semi-model categories are weak model categories, and the opposite of a weak model category is again a weak model category.\nThe main advantage of weak model categories is that they are easier to construct than Quillen model categories. In particular we give some simple criteria on two weak factorization systems for them to form a weak model category. The theory is developed in a very weak constructive, even predicative, framework and we use it to give constructive proofs of the existence of  weak versions of various standard model categories, including the Kan-Quillen model structure, Lurie's variant of the Joyal model structure on marked simplicial sets, and the Verity model structure for weak complicial sets.

This localization result has a natural application to the construction of the homotopy bicategory of a model bicategory, which we develop elsewhere, as the pair (C_{fc},W) given by the weak equivalences between fibrant-cofibrant objects satisfies the conditions given in the present article."},
