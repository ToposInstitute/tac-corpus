This 2-categorical refinement also provides a uniqueness statement concerning canonical triangulations.,,,,,,,
We introduce a new class of categories generalizing locally presentable ones.,,,,,,,
These biequivalences induce equivalences between the corresponding categories of algebras.,,,,,,,
There are three main ingredients in establishing these biequivalences.,,,,,,,
One motivation for this construction is an application to graph rewriting.,,,,,,,
"In this paper, we study properties of maps between fibrant objects in model categories.",,,,,,,

These variants of universal algebra are called {notions of algebraic theory}.,,,,,,,
"In this paper, we develop a unified framework for them.",,,,,,,
In this first installment we introduce the free globularly generated double category construction.,,,,,,,
Some concrete examples of categories where these results hold are examined in detail.,,,,,,,
"First, we characterize which prederivators arise on the nose as prederivators associated to quasicategories.",,,,,,,
We also discuss the question when that last assumption can be dropped.,,,,,,,
"Furthermore, terminal coalgebras are often constructed as limits of a certain type.",,,,,,,
We then give a syntactical characterization of left coextensive varieties of universal algebras.,,,,,,,
We consider such a distributor a weak analogue of adjunction.,,,,,,,
Poly-bicategories generalise planar polycategories in the same way as bicategories generalise monoidal categories.,,,,,,,
We construct model category structures on various types of (marked) *-categories.,,,,,,,
Let E be a topos.,,,,,,,
Let level 1 be the Aufhebung of level 0.,,,,,,,
We also discuss dual constructions.,,,,,,,
Consequently it is a monoidal category and a Lie groupoid.,,,,,,,
"Among algebraic majority categories are the categories of lattices, Boolean algebras and Heyting algebras.",,,,,,,
"In addition, we introduce the notion of maximal rigid subcategories in extriangulated categories.",,,,,,,
The case E = Set is of special interest.,,,,,,,
We refer to this problem as the problem of existence of internalizations for decorated bicategories.,,,,,,,
Motivated by this we introduce the condition of a double category being globularily generated.,,,,,,,

The most important example of the construction is the octonionic projective space.,,,,,,,
In this paper we develop a theory of Segal enriched categories.,,,,,,,
We introduce Segal dg-categories which did not exist so far.,,,,,,,
We analyze some of the sheaf theoretic aspects of this topos.,,,,,,,
In this paper we prove an equivalence theorem originally observed by Robert MacPherson.,,,,,,,
Analogous results for the associated homotopy limit (and other intermediate limits) directly follow.,,,,,,,
We also construct semi-simplicial versions of all these.,,,,,,,
Restriction categories were introduced as a way of generalising the notion of partial map category.,,,,,,,
"Cheng, Gurski, and Riehl constructed a cyclic double multicategory of multivariable adjunctions.",,,,,,,
We introduce `network models' to encode these ways of combining networks.,,,,,,,
Different network models describe different kinds of networks.,,,,,,,
