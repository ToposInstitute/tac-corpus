# TAC corpus

This repository contains a version of the metadata of the contents of TAC abstracts (as of c. December 2020), with the intention of being used as a training/testing corpus for mathematical NLP and machine learning projects. 

nlab_plain.txt contains urls, article titles, authors, keywords and text abstract from 1995.

A work-in-progress ontology of categorical concepts, extracted using Collard et al [root- and rule-based method](https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=919688), can be explored at  http://18.222.108.184:5050/. 
Note that the site may occasionally be down for updates and maintenance.
