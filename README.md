# TAC corpus

This repository contains a version of the metadata of the contents of TAC abstracts (as of c. December 2020), with the intention of being used as a training/testing corpus for mathematical NLP and machine learning projects. 

- `tac_abstracts.txt` contains urls, article titles, authors, keywords and text abstract from all articles from 1995.
- `tac_stats.txt` contains some basic statistics about the corpus, generated by
  [spaCy](https://spacy.io)
- `anp.txt` contains a list of ADJ + NOUN phrases, generated by spaCy.

A work-in-progress ontology of categorical concepts, extracted using Collard et al [root- and rule-based method](https://tsapps.nist.gov/publication/get_pdf.cfm?pub_id=919688), can be explored at  http://18.222.108.184:5050/.

## Corpus statistics

There are two types of part-of-speech tags in the corpus statistics, both
generated by spaCy. The first tagset, labeled "pos" in `nlab_stats.json`,
represents course-grained part of speech and is taken from the 
[Universal POS tag set](https://universaldependencies.org/docs/u/pos/). The
second tagset, "tag", is specific to spaCy's pretrained English model. 

Details about the different tagsets, as well as other label schemes for this
model, can be found on [spaCy's website](https://spacy.io/models/en).
